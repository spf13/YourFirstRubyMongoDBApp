Setup:
   It is based on the following Gems
    - Bundler
    - Shotgun
    - Rack
    - Haml
    - Mongo
    - Vlad the Deployer

  To get up and running all that should be needed is to install the Ruby gem
Bundler if up don't already have it installed then run:
    - $ bundle install

  That should install everything that is need for the app to run. To start it
run:
    - $ shotgun

  As is the case with any Shotgun app you can update the config.ru file to
change Shotgun settings. Like wise /config/deploy.rb for the Vlad settings and
Gemfile for your bundler install settings

enjoy!
